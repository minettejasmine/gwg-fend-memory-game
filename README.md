## Instructions

Welcome to the Memory Game! This game is also known as Concentration. This game was developed for the Grow With Google Udacity Front-End Developer (FEND) Nanodegree. 

To get started, open `index.html` and the game board should appear in your internet browser. There are 16 black squares, representing the 16 cards containing 8 pairs (two of a kind) in the game. There is a refresh button at the top right of the cards. At the top left of the cards, there is a player statistics panel featuring a timer, a star rating, and move counter. Single-clicking the refresh button will turn all cards over (to black), shuffle the cards, and reset all data in the statistics panel.

Start the game by clicking (single-click) on any card. The timer will begin when the first card is clicked. When clicked, the card will flip over to reveal an image. Click on a different card to reveal the second hidden image. The move counter will increment each time two different cards (any pair - matching or not matching) are clicked.

If the images of the two cards match, then the cards remain face up. If the two cards do not match, then those two cards automatically flip back down (to black) after approximately 1 second.

The game ends when all 16 cards - 8 pairs - are matched. A modal will appear and will highlight the player's final game statistics. A message in the modal will ask the user if they want to play again. The user can choose one of two buttons in the modal to either end play or play another game.

## Requirements

To play the game, an internet browser and a mechanism to click (mouse, trackpad, touchscreen) are required.

For development details and review, the following files can be opened with a text editor: `index.html`, `app.css`, and `app.js`.
